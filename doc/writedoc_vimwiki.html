<p>Document are expected to be updated with code change and managed by Perforce.

<p>The documents are created using Vim+Vimwiki except the index page (index.html) that is maintained manually.
Vim is a text editor widely used on Unix-like system, and Vimwiki is a plug-in of Vim for creating personal wiki.

<h3>Install Vim+Vimwiki</h3>

<p>Install Vim (version 7.3+) on Windows. On Linux, Vim is installed by default.

<p>Get vimwiki on p4 in the same folder:
<pre>
vimwiki-2-1-LJ.vba
</pre>
<p>This version is based on vimwiki 2.1 and has some modification by me.

<p>To install vimwiki, open the vba file in Vim and run this command:

<pre>
:so %
</pre>

<p>[Note] To generate our HTML document, please set this special vimwiki option in Vim:

<pre>
" for vimwiki
filetype plugin on
let g:vimwiki_html_header_numbering=2
let g:vimwiki_folding='expr'
</pre>

<p>On Windows, please add it into the _vimrc file under the Vim folder.

<p>For detail, please refer to Vimwiki main page.

<h3>Write wiki file and generate HTML Document</h3>

<p>The wiki file is just text file and is recommended to edit in Vim. Here's a simple template for our documents:

<xmp>
	= <Document-Name> =
By <Author> - last update: <Year/Month>

%title <Document-Name>
%toc

== <Chapter-1> ==

=== <Chapter-1.1> ===

</xmp>

<p>Press shortcut <b>\wh</b> in Vim. By default the HTML document is generated in the folder doc_html.

<p>For detail usage of vimwiki, read the help document in Vim:

<pre>
:h vimwiki
</pre>

<p>[Note]

<p>File "style.css" is required to format the page. Please put it together with the HTML pages.
